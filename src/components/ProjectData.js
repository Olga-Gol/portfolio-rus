                    SHELTER is a mobile adaptation of a strategic board game where players receive a random set of cards
                    representing traits such as gender, age, and profession. The objective is to persuade others that your
                    characterâ€™s attributes enhance survival chances in a bunker scenario.

                    My first dive into iOS development, built with React Native and Expo. While mostly frontend-focused, I used Node.js
                    for prototyping early API endpoints (like card data fetching). The final app runs
                    offline, but the Node experiments helped me grasp full-stack workflows.

                        Built a full-stack <strong>Minesweeper-style game</strong> using
                        <strong> Java</strong> and <strong>Spring Boot</strong> for the backend, with a
                        clean and responsive frontend in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>,
                        and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

                        game state server-side, and deploying a live application using

                        This is a classic Minesweeper game with a slightly chaotic twist â€” instead of mines,
                        you're trying to avoid stepping on vicious kittens. Same rules, different stakes.

                    </p>
                    The game is publicly available at{" "}
